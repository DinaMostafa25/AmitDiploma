Historically, the expert systems that were built to do this kind of task were extremely complicated, and people spent their careers building them (check out the references on the [official MNIST page](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and the years milestones were reached).\n",

Having trouble getting a fancy new machine learning architecture working? Check it against MNIST. If it can't learn on this dataset, chances are it won't learn on more complicated images and datasets."
